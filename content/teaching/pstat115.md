An introduction to the Bayesian approach to statistical inference, its theoretical foundations and comparison to classical methods. Topics include parameter estimation, testing, prediction and computational methods (Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation). Emphasis on concepts, methods and data analysis. Extensive use of the R programming language and examples from the social, biological and physical sciences to illustrate concepts. Prerequisite:	PSTAT 126 with a minimum grade of C.
