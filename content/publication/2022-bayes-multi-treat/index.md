abstract: '
In causal estimation problems, the parameter of interest is often only partially identified, implying that
the parameter cannot be recovered exactly, even with infinite data. Here, we study Bayesian inference
for partially identified treatment effects in multi-treatment causal inference problems with unobserved
confounding. In principle, inferring the partially identified treatment effects is natural under the Bayesian
paradigm, but the results can be highly sensitive to parameterization and prior specification, often in
surprising ways. It is thus essential to understand which aspects of the conclusions about treatment
effects are driven entirely by the prior specification. We use a so-called transparent parameterization to
contextualize the effects of more interpretable scientifically motivated prior specifications on the multiple
effects. We demonstrate our analysis in an example quantifying the effects of gene expression levels on
mouse obesity.'
