abstract: Although basketball is a dualistic sport, with all players competing on
  both offense and defense, almost all of the sporttextquoterights conventional metrics
  are designed to summarize offensive play. As a result, player valuations are largely
  based on offensive performances and to a much lesser degree on defensive ones. Steals,
  blocks, and defensive rebounds provide only a limited summary of defensive effectiveness,
  yet they persist because they summarize salient events that are easy to observe.
  Due to the inefficacy of traditional defensive statistics, the state of the art
  in defensive analytics remains qualitative, based on expert intuition and analysis
  that can be prone to human biases and imprecision.  Fortunately, emerging optical
  player tracking systems have the potential to enable a richer quantitative characterization
  of basketball performance, particularly defensive performance. Unfortunately, due
  to computational and methodological complexities, that potential remains unmet.
  This paper attempts to fill this void, combining spatial and spatio-temporal processes,
  matrix factorization techniques, and hierarchical regression models with player
  tracking data to advance the state of defensive analytics in the NBA. Our approach
  detects, characterizes, and quantifies multiple aspects of defensive play in basketball,
  supporting some common understandings of defensive effectiveness, challenging others,
  and opening up many new insights into the defensive elements of basketball.
