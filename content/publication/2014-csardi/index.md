abstract: Cells respond to their environment by modulating protein levels through
  mRNA transcription and post-transcriptional control. Modest correlations between
  global steady-state mRNA and protein measurements have been interpreted as evidence
  that transcript levels determine roughly 40% of the variation in protein levels,
  indicating dominant post-transcriptional effects. However, the techniques underlying
  these conclusions, such as correlation and regression, yield biased results when
  data are noisy, missing systematically, and collinear—properties of mRNA and protein
  measurements—which motivated us to revisit this subject. Noise-robust analyses of
  25 studies of budding yeast reveal that mRNA levels explain roughly 80% of the variation
  in steady-state protein levels. Post-transcriptional regulation amplifies rather
  than competes with the transcriptional signal. Measurements are highly reproducible
  within but not between studies, and are distorted in part by between-study differences
  in gene expression. These results substantially revise current models of protein-level
  regulation and introduce multiple noise-aware approaches essential for proper analysis
  of many biological phenomena.
