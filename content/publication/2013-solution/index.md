abstract: Genetic algorithms (GAs) have been used to find efficient solutions to numerous
  fundamental and applied problems. While GAs are a robust and flexible approach to
  solve complex problems, there are some situations under which they perform poorly.
  Here, we introduce a genetic algorithm approach that is able to solve complex tasks
  plagued by so-called ''golf-course''-like fitness landscapes. Our approach, which
  we denote variable environment genetic algorithms (VEGAs), is able to find highly
  efficient solutions by inducing environmental changes that require more complex
  solutions and thus creating an evolutionary drive. Using the density classification
  task, a paradigmatic computer science problem, as a case study, we show that more
  complex rules that preserve information about the solution to simpler tasks can
  adapt to more challenging environments. Interestingly, we find that conservative
  strategies, which have a bias toward the current state, evolve naturally as a highly
  efficient solution to the density classification task under noisy conditions.
