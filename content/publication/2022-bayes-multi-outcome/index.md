abstract: We propose an approach for assessing sensitivity to unobserved confounding
  in studies with multiple outcomes. Under a shared confounding assumption, we argue
  that it is often reasonable to use residual dependence amongst outcomes to infer
  a proxy distribution for unobserved confounders. We focus on a class of factor models
  for which we can bound the causal effects for all outcomes conditional on a single
  sensitivity parameter that represents the fraction of treatment variance explained
  by unobserved confounders.  We further characterize how causal ignorance regions
  shrink under assumptions about null control outcomes, propose strategies for benchmarking
  sensitivity parameters, and derive metrics for quantifying the robustness of effect
  estimates. Finally, we propose a Bayesian inference strategy for quantifying uncertainty
  and describe a practical sensitivity workflow which we demonstrate in both simulation
  and in a case study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
  Survey (NHANES). <center><img src="/img/factor_confounding.png" width="80%" /></center>
