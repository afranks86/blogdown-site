abstract: 'We consider data-analysis settings where data are missing not at random.
  In these cases, the two basic modeling approaches are 1) pattern-mixture models,
  with separate distributions for missing data and observed data, and 2) selection
  models, with a distribution for the data preobservation and a missing-data mechanism
  that selects which data are observed. These two modeling approaches lead to distinct
  factorizations of the joint distribution of the observed-data and missing-data indicators.
  In this paper, we explore a third approach, apparently originally proposed by J.
  W. Tukey as a remark in a discussion between Rubin and Hartigan, and reported by
  Holland in a two-page note, which has been so far neglected.Data analyses typically
  rely upon assumptions about the missingness mechanisms that lead to observed versus
  missing data, assumptions that are typically unassessable. We explore an approach
  where the joint distribution of observed data and missing data are specified in
  a nonstandard way. In this formulation, which traces back to a representation of
  the joint distribution of the data and missingness mechanism, apparently first proposed
  by J. W. Tukey, the modeling assumptions about the distributions are either assessable
  or are designed to allow relatively easy incorporation of substantive knowledge
  about the problem at hand, thereby offering a possibly realistic portrayal of the
  data, both observed and missing. We develop Tukeytextquoterights representation
  for exponential-family models, propose a computationally tractable approach to inference
  in this class of models, and offer some general theoretical comments. We then illustrate
  the utility of this approach with an example in systems biology.All raw input and
  processed output data are available in Dryad (DOI: 10.5061/dryad.rg367 and DOI:
  10.5061/dryad.d644f).'
