abstract: 'Recent work has focused on the potential and pitfalls of causal identification in observational studies
with multiple simultaneous treatments. On the one hand, a latent variable model fit to the observed
treatments can identify essential aspects of the distribution of unobserved confounders. On the other
hand, it has been shown that even when the latent confounder distribution is known exactly, causal effects
are still not point identifiable. Thus, the practical benefits of latent variable modeling in multi-treatment
settings remain unclear. We clarify these issues with a sensitivity analysis method that can be used
to characterize the range of causal effects that are compatible with the observed data. Our method is
based on a copula factorization of the joint distribution of outcomes, treatments, and confounders, and
can be layered on top of arbitrary observed data models. We propose a practical implementation of this
approach making use of the Gaussian copula, and establish conditions under which causal effects can
be bounded. We also describe approaches for reasoning about effects, including calibrating sensitivity
parameters, quantifying robustness of effect estimates, and selecting models which are most consistent
with prior hypotheses.'
