I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics and Applied Probability at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My research interests include covariance estimation, multivariate analysis and high dimensional data, causal inference, missing data, and errors-in-variables models.

My applied research interests include computational and statistical modeling of "omics" data.
